Author / Original Creator: Brandon Lacasse

Project Description:
This project was originally going to be hosted over at www.insertcoinstudios.com but due to errors with our uploads system we decided to move to github,
for a stable collaborative environment while we fix our website.  Files in this project are free for people to play with, build with the code provided and learn your
way around Unity3d.  I will be adding tutorial files over time to help newcomers learn more on the project.

What you will need:
- Files provided here will require Unity3d: www.unity3d.com
- Reccomend signing up at www.insertcoinstudios.com and visiting our Game Design Resources section for ongoing discussion.
- A passion to learn.

Updates:
This project will be updated weekly (usually about once a week by the creator, as often as needed by the community).
Follow us on twitter @IC_Studios, and @Sayaer for up-to-the-day updates on the project.
This README will be updated over time as well.

Notes:
Project started by Brandon Lacasse (CEO/Creative Director of Insert Coin Studios LLC) to give back to the communites that got me started in game development.
I'm an indie developer that runs our studio full time throughout the week, and work full time Weds-Sat to pay my bills.  The biggest thing you can give back to me for
this project is participation and feedback.  I'll be updating this project as often as i have time to when not working on our primary studio projects.  Thank you for 
participating.
